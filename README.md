# Project: Predicting Stock Price using Numerical Analysis Methods

## Introduction
This project aims to predict stock prices using numerical analysis methods. The script utilizes historical stock data, interpolates the data using cubic spline, and estimates future stock prices using the trapezoidal rule. The objective is to provide an estimation of the stock price for a given prediction date based on the available data.

## Objectives
- Retrieve historical stock data using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).
- Interpolate the stock data using cubic spline to obtain a smooth curve.
- Estimate the stock price for a specific prediction date using the trapezoidal rule.
- Visualize the original stock data, interpolation, and estimated stock price on a plot.

## Methods
1. Import necessary libraries, including yfinance for data retrieval, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib for plotting, CubicSpline for interpolation, and datetime for handling dates.
2. Define functions:
   - `get_stock_data(ticker, start, end)`: Retrieves stock data for a given ticker symbol, start date, and end date using the Yahoo Finance API.
   - `interpolate_stock_data(dates, prices)`: Interpolates the stock data using cubic spline to obtain a smooth curve.
   - `estimate_stock_price(interp, start_date, end_date, num_intervals)`: Estimates the stock price by applying the trapezoidal rule to the interpolated data within the specified date range.
3. Declare the settings and parameters:
   - `ticker`: Ticker symbol of the stock to analyze (e.g., 'NVDA' for NVIDIA).
   - `start` and `end`: Start and end dates for the historical stock data.
   - `num_intervals`: Number of intervals to divide the date range for estimating the stock price.
   - `prediction_date`: Date for which the stock price will be estimated.
4. Retrieve stock data using `get_stock_data()` and reset the index.
5. Convert the dates in the stock data to numerical values for interpolation.
6. Interpolate the stock prices using `interpolate_stock_data()`.
7. Estimate the stock price for the prediction date by applying the trapezoidal rule with `estimate_stock_price()`.
8. Print the estimated stock price for the prediction date.
9. Plot the original stock data, interpolation, and estimated stock price on a graph using matplotlib.

## Expected Outcome
The expected outcome of this project is to obtain an estimated stock price for a given prediction date based on historical stock data. The interpolation using cubic spline provides a smooth curve, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the stock price. The trapezoidal rule is used to calculate the integral of the interpolated data within the specified date range, providing an estimation of the average stock price during that period.

## Results
The results of running the script will include:
- The estimated stock price for the specified prediction date.
- Two plots:
  1. The original stock data points and the interpolated curve.
  2. The original stock data points with the x-axis labels converted back to date format for better readability.

The plots visualize the historical stock data, the smooth curve obtained through interpolation, and the estimated stock price for the prediction date. These visualizations help in understanding the trend and potential future behavior of the stock price.

## Limitations
- The accuracy of the estimated stock price heavily relies on the quality and availability of the historical stock data. Incomplete or unreliable data may lead to less accurate predictions.
- The interpolation technique (cubic spline) assumes a smooth curve between the data points, which may not always accurately capture the underlying stock price behavior.
- The trapezoidal rule provides an approximation of the integral, and the accuracy of the estimated stock price depends on the number of intervals chosen and the behavior of the stock prices within those intervals.
- The prediction is based solely on numerical analysis methods and does not take into account external factors such as market trends, news, or fundamental analysis, which can significantly impact stock prices.

## Possible Improvements
- Consider using alternative interpolation techniques, such as piecewise linear interpolation or polynomial interpolation, to compare the results and improve accuracy.
- Incorporate additional features or indicators, such as volume data or technical indicators, to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Implement machine learning algorithms, such as regression or time series models, to capture more complex patterns and potentially improve the accuracy of stock price predictions.
- Explore the use of sentiment analysis or natural language processing techniques to incorporate textual data from news articles or social media, which can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potentially improve prediction accuracy.
- Conduct thorough backtesting and evaluation of the model using historical data to assess its performance and refine the methodology.

Note: The results will vary based on the selected stock, historical data availability, and the prediction date.
